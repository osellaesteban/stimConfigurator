# Stimulator configurator
**Esteban Osella - Programación de dispositivos móviles - Especialización en sistemas embebidos FI-UNER**

This project is a prototype for configuring  via bluetooth a Functional electrical stimulator device operated using a ESP32 device. The sample ESP program only shows in a serial terminal the uploaded configuration and test. 

The dialog between devices is performed via JSON messages. 
### ToDo list:
+ Generate a css class for the style of the buttons.
+ Generate a server to store the configurations. 
+ When connecting,  the stimulator should talk with the phone things like number of channels and limiting configuration parameters.
